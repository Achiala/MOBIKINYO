PROJECT SCOPE
OVERVIEW
1.	PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION
Searching out for the best barbershops or hair salons within your vicinity is a very tiresome task. Also, visiting a barbershop or salon without a prior appointment booking can keep you waiting in a queue thereby taking away your precious time. MOBIKINYO is an android based barbershop application that will help solve this problem. By entering a location this android app will generate a list of nearby barbershops and salons. Both the barbershop owners and users can access the application by registering themselves on the app by submitting the necessary details. The barbershop owners can update their profiles by adding photos and a list of services provided by them. The users can view the shops' profiles, photos and services, based on which they can book an appointment as per their desired time  in their favourite shops. The users can even request the service to be brought to the comfort of their house and they can also review and rate a shop through this app

Barber Application is used for booking barber services through android application. Admin is the authorized user who will verify Barber shop & its services.
